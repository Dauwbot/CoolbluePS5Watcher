## PS5 ECOMMERCE SITES WATCHER

------

This project will maybe permit me to grab a PS5 ðŸŽ® at launch in Europe (19/11/20). 

It act like a web crawler by watching an url at a fixed interval and assessing if it's possible to add the item to cart. If it is possible it send a mail and a SMS to a designated recipient.

##### Skills learned from project ðŸ’»

- Hiding sensible user data in JSON files and accessing those fields using Microsoft.Extension.Configuration
- Using and configuring Twilio CLI to acquire a phone number
- Using Twilio from code to send SMS
- Sending an Email from code using MailKit

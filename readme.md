## PS5 ECOMMERCE SITES WATCHER

This project will maybe allow me to grab a PS5 üéÆ at launch in Europe (19/11/20).

It could be updated to target any kind of ecommerce website and any kind of item. Note: The user still need to manually add to cart and order for the item, I'm not trying to create a bot but rather to help people (especially myself) to get the item they want without having to constantly refresh a webpage.

It act like a web crawler by watching an url at a random interval and assessing if it's possible to add the item to cart. If it is possible it open the web browser on the URL, send a mail and a SMS to a designated recipient.

Project as taken a bit of a bigger development path

#### How to use

You will need to grab a free [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) which come with 15.50$. The steps to create a phone number and use it are described [there](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/csharp-dotnet-core). I'm not responsible about your invoices üí≤üí≤üí≤

You also need a SMTP capable mail provider, I use Google SMTP with MailKit, less than 10 lines code to send a mail.

Finally, you need to set the correct information into an `appSecrets.json` file, just rename and update the `appSecrets.example` file.

No help compiling and running this code will be given, you're on your own.

Target framework is [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) since I use the new `is not or` operators.

#### Skills learned from project üíª

- Hiding sensible user data in JSON files and accessing those fields using `Microsoft.Extension.Configuration`
- Web scraping using Selenium as a headless browser
  - Pick from a random list of proxies for each request
  - Modify the `User-Agent` header between each request to make it seems like it's different browser requesting the page
  - In the hope to bypass browser flagging and having to resolve a captcha
- Using and configuring Twilio CLI to acquire a phone number
- Using Twilio from code to send SMS
- Sending an Email from code using MailKit & Google SMTP server
- Hashing the content of a file to compare it to another. Did not work since some tracking elements change between each HTTP request ‚ùå. Had to resort to search directly in the HTML stream after each scraping
